# Overview of the Spreadsheet functionality
The Spreadsheet is the main project that is aimed to function like 
an excel file when it's completed. The coding language is C#. The Framework is ".NET 6.0".

It currently includes classes and functions that are capable of evaluating arithmetic 
expressions using standard infix notation. The evaluator will support expressions
with variables whose values are looked up via a delegate.

It also includes a test file as a Console App. It tests the "FormulaEvaluator" class Library.

Future extensions: There will be future additions to this project. This is an 
ongoing project for CS 3500 class. Future projects and/or extensions will be 
announced later on and updated over time.
