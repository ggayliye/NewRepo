# Overview of the FormulaEvaluator functionality
The FormulaEvaluator class is a "packaged" programming unit called a "library".
Therefore, it is not a standalone executable. Instead, contains codes that are 
used by other programs to achieve their goal.

Currently, it is capable of evaluating arithmetic expressions 
using standard infix notation. It supports expressions
with variables whose values are looked up via a delegate.

Future extensions: This FormulaEvaluator class is a part of an ongoing project 
for the CS 3500 class. Future additions will be announced and updated over time.


# Comments to Evaluators:
Thank you for your work and effort in checking my assignment. Have a wonderful day!


# Assignment Specific Topics
The "Evaluate" method in this FormulaEvaluator class implements the arithmetic
functionality of mathematical infix expressions. It is capable of
detecting illegal expressions and returning the final result of the
rendered infix expression.
